  Testing comment section, the compiler will identify the open section and will eclude this 
  few lines from the compilation process to avoid possible misbehaving like defining a function 
  inside this scope like this:

  def struct test{
    str: name;
    int: data;
  };

  fn umom(str: name, doube: weight) -> float{
    ret(weight as float);
  }



/-



fn main(str: name, str:surname, int: born_date) -> str {  
  ret();
}
